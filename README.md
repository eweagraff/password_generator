# Password Generator

## Description:

The following page displays a random password generator. The javascript needed to be manipulated in order to create a random password between 8-128 characters. The user was given choices between including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers and special characters in their random password. In order to accomplish this, I created a function including if/else statements. I utilized the skills learned this past week, including arrays, if/else statements, functions, coditionals, creating variables, and for loops.
