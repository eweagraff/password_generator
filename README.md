# Password Generator

## Description:

The following page displays a random password generator. The javascript needed to be manipulated in order to create a random password between 8-128 characters, which included letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers and special characters. In order to accomplish this, I created a function including if/else statements. I also created variables for the function.
